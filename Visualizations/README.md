# Email Phishing Detection Visualizations

![Project Banner](phishing_wordcloud.png)

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the Enron email dataset to visualize key differences between phishing and legitimate emails. The visualizations help identify patterns that can improve phishing detection systems.

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. Email Class Distribution
![Class Distribution](class_distribution.png)
- Shows the proportion of phishing (1) vs legitimate (0) emails
- Helps assess dataset balance for machine learning

### 2. Phishing Word Cloud
![Word Cloud](phishing_wordcloud.png)
- Visualizes most frequent words in phishing emails
- Larger words = more frequent appearances
- Reveals common phishing vocabulary patterns

### 3. Email Length Analysis
![Length Analysis](email_length_analysis.png)
- Compares character length of email bodies
- Shows median and distribution of lengths
- Phishing emails often have distinct length patterns

### 4. Subject Line Word Frequency
![Subject Analysis](subject_word_analysis.png)
- Compares top words in phishing vs legitimate subjects
- Highlights suspicious subject line patterns

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`

### Installation
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

How to Run
Place Enron.csv in the project directory

Run the visualization script:

bash
python visualizations.py
Find generated images in the same directory

📂 Files
Enron.csv - Original dataset

visualizations.py - Python script to generate all plots

*.png - Generated visualization images

🔍 Key Findings
The dataset contains [X]% phishing emails and [Y]% legitimate emails

Most common phishing words: [Word1], [Word2], [Word3]

Phishing emails tend to be [shorter/longer] than legitimate ones

Suspicious subject words: [WordA], [WordB]

📈 Next Steps
Add interactive visualizations with Plotly

Implement machine learning classification

Analyze email header patterns

Develop real-time phishing detection
